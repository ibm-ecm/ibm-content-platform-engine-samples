# IBM Content Platform Engine samples

## Scope

This repository contains various samples that can be used to extend Content Platform Engine.

## Sample projects
Here are a list of sample projects in this repository:
  - [**Content Event Webhook Receiver sample application**](ContentEventWebhookReceiver)
    - The Content Event Webhook Receiver sample application project contains code for creating a sample application that can be used as a Content Event Webhook Receiver. The application can be used as the base or inspiration for creating a custom Content Event Webhook Receiver application. The code for the sample application also contains examples of how to call the Content Services GraphQL API to retrieve data and make changes on a Content Platform Engine object store.
  - [**Content Services GraphQL API Schema**](CS-GraphQL-Schema)
      - The Content Services GraphQL API Schema project contains the GraphQL Schema file that defines the schema of the Content Services GraphQL API.
  - [**Content Services GraphQL API Deploy Scripts**](CSGraphQLAPIDeployScripts/websphere)
    - The Content Services GraphQL API Deploy Scripts project contains a set of instructions and scripts to help deploy the Content Services GraphQL API application on a traditional WebSphere Application Server.
  - [**Content Services GraphQL API Javascript Sample Application**](CS-GraphQL-javascript-samples)
    - The Content Services GraphQL API Javascript Sample Application contains a sample Javascript WebApplication to demonstrate basic communication with GraphQL API. This code demonstrates how to leverage GraphQL API to communicate and manipulate Content Platform Engine Object Store, and is intended for usage as inspiration and or base for custom applications.
  - [**Content Services Deployment API**](CS-Deployment-API)
    - The Content Services Deployment API project contains a sample that demonstrates usage of Jupyter Notebook to invoke Content Services Deployment API to deploy metadata such as Property Templates, Choices Lists, and Class Definitions across Content Platform Engine (CPE) Object Stores (OS) â€“ export from source CPE domain/OS then import into destination CPE domain/OS.
  - [**Content Validation with ClamAV sample application**](ClamAVContentValidator)
    - The Content validation with ClamAV sample contains code for a content validator which utilises the ClamAV service to virus-check incoming content.
  - [**WAS CPE Must Gather Scripts**](MustGather)
    - The Content Platform Engine Must Gather scripts for WebSphere Application Server project contains scripts to help collect logs and other necessary debugging information from people using the WebSphere installation of FileNet Content Manager.
    
Note that the previously available **Content Services on Amazon Web Services sample applications** added in the [CPE 5.5.12 Release](https://github.com/ibm-ecm/ibm-content-platform-engine-samples/releases/tag/v5.5.12.0) have been removed, as those sample applications were specific for use with Content Services on Amazon Web Services.  The Content Services on Amazon Web Services offering has since been discontinued. However, the Content Platform Engine documentation has sample code to authenticate with an OAuth token. For that sample code, see [Single sign-on integrations via Content Engine API Bearer Token Authentication](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/filenet-p8-platform/5.6.0?topic=authentication-single-sign-integrations-via-content-engine-api-bearer-token).
